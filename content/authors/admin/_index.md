I am a Ph.D. candidate at Northeastern University working as a Research Assistant at Secure Systems Lab (SecLab). My research is currently focused on Web Security and Privacy. I have previously worked on browser fingerprinting analysis in different browser vendors. My last project was focused on preserving user privacy by limiting the data shared between ad exchanges by adding security layers to the browsers to preserve user privacy and prevent cookie syncing methods.\
Besides research, I have around 4 years of work experience in the industry as a DevOps and Software Engineer which helped me improve my technical skills by working in agile teams with lots of technical challenges to explore.
